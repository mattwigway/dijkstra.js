      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's algorithm</a>
	is an algorithm for finding the shortest path on a network or graph. A graph, in the mathematical
	sense, is a collection of nodes or points, which are connected by edges or links which may have
	some weight. For example, a road network might have intersections represented as nodes,
	road segments represented as edges, with weights being the length of the segments.
	The algorithm was invented by Edsger Dijkstra in the late 1950s, and works as follows. First,
	one identifies a starting node, from which one wants to find a shortest path.
	Optionally, one then identifies an ending node; without an ending node, shortest paths
	to every connected node are found. Click on a node in graph above to set a starting location,
	and then click run to see the algorithm find shortest paths. Put your cursor over a node
	to see the shortest path to that point.</p>

      <p>Central to the algorithm is the <i>priority queue,</i> which is basically just a
	sorted list. Also central to the algorithm is the concept of a <i>weight</i> or
	<i>cost,</i> which is just a measure of distance. This could be geographic distance,
	time, or some other measure of separation. Every edge, from one node to another, has
	a weight, and the shortest path from a node <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> is the sequence of edges
	with the least cumulative weight.</p>

      <p>The algorithm starts by initializing the priority queue, which contains nodes and the
	cost to reach them. The starting node is inserted into the queue with a cost of 0, and
	then the algorithm's main loop is started. The loop is as follows:</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>Pull the lowest-weight node from the priority queue.</li>
	  <li><i>Label</i> that node with its cost; this is the length of the shortest path from the
	    starting point to that node. There can be no shorter path, because all of the nodes
	    remaining in the priority queue have higher costs, so exploring further from them
	    will never yield a lower-cost path. (This does require that all of the edge costs be nonnegative).</li>
	  <li>Add all of the neighbors of the node (that is, all of the nodes that are directly
	    connected to this node by an edge) to the priority queue, with cost being the cost
	    of the node drawn in step 1 plus the length of the edge that connects it to the neighbor.
	    If the neighbor is already in the priority queue with a higher cost, change the cost.
	    If the neighbor is in the priority queue with a lower cost (that is, there is a shorter
	    way to get to the neighbor without going through this node), do nothing. Finally, if the
	    neighbor was not in the priority queue or if it was in the priority queue with a higher
	    cost, record the node drawn in step 1 as the previous node on the shortest path.
	    This information may be overwritten if a shorter way to the node is discovered.
	    This allows reconstructing the path to a node by repeatedly looking at the previous node.</li>
	  <li>Repeat 1&ndash;3 until the destination node is labeled by step 2, or the priority queue is empty,
	    which means that the destination is unreachable. Without a destination, repeat until the priority
	    queue is empty to discover all paths in the graph.</li>
	</ol>

      <p>The visualization above can be initialized by clicking a node to set the the starting location. The
	starting node will be highlighted in orange. The algorithm can then be run (by clicking the run button) or
	single stepped (by clicking the single step button). Single-stepping the algorithm draws a single node from
	the priority queue, labels it, and explores its neighbors. Nodes are colored light gray if they have not been
	reached, dark red if they are in the priority queue, and on a scale from dark gray to blue (based on low to high cost)
	if they have been labeled. The red nodes are rougly equidistant from the starting point.
	The graph is the street grid of the Downtown and Mesa neighborhoods of
	Santa Barbara, California, USA (in a nod to my <a href="http://geog.ucsb.edu">undergraduate days</a>). Hovering over
	a labeled node highlights the shortest path to it. Note that a search starting in the downtown area expands
	in a square, because the streets are a grid and thus the edges of a square are equidistant from the starting point.
	Since there are many paths exactly the same length through the grid, the algorithm picks the last path explored;
	this is an implementation detail. As the search progresses, the widths of edges scale based on the number
	of shortest paths that have used them, as inspired by work by
	<a href="http://graphserver.github.io/graphserver/gallery.html">Brandon Martin-Anderson</a>. Of course, this weights more heavily
	paths that lead to areas with more nodes, for instance Santa Barbara City College in the bottom-center.</p>

      <p>One of the most useful aspects of Dijkstra's algorithm is that it generates not only shortest paths from <i>a</i>
	to <i>b</i>, but also from <i>a</i> to all nodes closer than <i>b</i>. This means that it is computationally
	feasible to generate, for example, <a href="http://www.indicatrix.org/2014/11/01/accessibility-analysis-with-python-and-opentripplanner/">paths from every grocery store to every Census block in Chicago</a>, or <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/01/best-maps-weve-seen-sandys-transit-outage-new-york/4488/">every part of New York to every other part, before and after Hurricane Sandy</a>. (I made the first map; credit for the second map goes to co-contributors to <a href="http://www.opentripplanner.org">OpenTripPlanner</a>.)</p>

      <p>There are other methods, known as <i>heuristics</i>, that are used for point-a-to-point-b searches. Rather than simply
	following every possible path from an origin, as Dijkstra does, they make educated guesses as to which paths
	are likely to pan out and eliminate paths that, for instance, go long distances away from the destination. This is much how
	humans plan trips, but does not guarantee the shortest path, especially when different travel modes are involved. For
	example, the fastest way from Imperial, CA (east of Los Angeles) to Columbus, OH, is probably to drive west to
	Los Angeles International, in the wrong direction, and then take a non-stop flight. Different heuristics have been developed
	that attempt to account for this problem. Dijkstra, however, is guaranteed to find the best path regardless of how convoluted
	it is.</p>
